		<p>
			In the second course project, we build a web application that is used for <b
				>repeated practice of learned content</b
			>. The application provides a list of topics and allows creating multiple-choice questions into
			those topics that are then answered by self and others. The application also shows basic
			statistics: the total number of available questions and the total number of question answers. In
			addition, the application also provides an API for retrieving and answering random questions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The application must use a <b>three-tier architecture (client, server, database)</b> and a
			<b>layered architecture with four layers (views, controllers, services, database)</b>.
			Furthermore, the application naturally needs to be built using <b>Deno and Oak</b>.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you haven't used the application before, you can start by <a class="anchor" href="/auth/register"
				>registering</a
			>. If you have been here before, just <a class="anchor" href="/auth/login">log in</a>!
		</p>
